## How merging binary black holes form?
- Evindece of a subpopulation of low mass, spinning binary black holes consistent with low mass hierarchical mergers, [Tong et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05316), 2025
- Evidence of the pair-instability gap in the mass distribution of binary black holes in GWTC-4, [Tong et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04151), 2025
- Whether there exists a negligible spin subpopulation of binary black holes in GWTC-3, [Tong et al.](https://journals.aps.org/prd/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevD.106.103019), 2022

## What binary black holes reveal about the Universe’s history
- Gravitational-wave cosmology inference in the absence of EM counterpart of gravitational wave detections: isolating the cosmological information from the intrinsic mass-spin correlation of the binary black hole population, [Tong et al.](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/adcec5), 2025

## Advanced data analysis techniques

- Transidimensional inference (also known as reversible jump MCMC in the context of MCMC samplers) using Bilby, [Tong et al.](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4365/ad9deb), 2025
