I am a PhD student studying gravitational-wave astrophysics at Monash University. I use gravitational waves to study the compact object mergers in the universe (e.g. black holes). I am a member of  [LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Collaboration](https://www.ligo.caltech.edu) and the [OzGrav Center of Excellence](https://www.ozgrav.org). Check out my [research page](/research/) for details about my current work.
